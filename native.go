// the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook post). As such, the response must be
// well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.
// The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as
// a native type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as
// banner and/or video by also including as Imp subordinates the Banner and/or Video objects,
// respectively. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
